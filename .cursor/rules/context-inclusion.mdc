# Context Folder Auto-Inclusion

Always include the `/context` folder and its key files when starting conversations to provide essential project context.

## Core Context Files

The following files should always be available for context:

- **Project Goals & Roadmap**: [context/goals.txt](mdc:context/goals.txt) - Contains high-level objectives, completed features, current tasks, and future roadmap
- **Project Context**: [context/ctx.txt](mdc:context/ctx.txt) - Core project documentation and context
- **Project Rules**: [context/rules.txt](mdc:context/rules.txt) - Essential project guidelines and constraints

## Why This Matters

The `/context` folder contains the living documentation of this project's:
- Current state and progress
- Design decisions and architectural choices
- Testing approaches and validation criteria
- Future plans and priorities

Having this context available ensures that all conversations are grounded in the project's current reality and can make informed suggestions that align with established goals and constraints.

## Usage

When the AI assistant starts a conversation, it should automatically have access to these context files to:
- Understand what has been completed vs. what's still needed
- Align suggestions with existing architectural decisions
- Avoid recommending approaches that conflict with established patterns
- Build upon existing work rather than starting from scratch
